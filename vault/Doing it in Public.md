This is my Permanent Notes. 
## Principles

Atomicity,
Write in my own words,
Enough context information,
Lifelong tool for knowledge management,

A tranquil and peaceful pastoral scene. The air is filled with the sweet scent of freshly cut watermelon, and children are playing by the river, their laughter sounding like heavenly music that harmonizes with nature's melody. Everything seems so ordinary, yet it brings a sense of contentment and happiness. Under the ancient locust tree at the village entrance, several elderly people are leisurely playing chess, occasionally breaking into laughter and grand discussions about life. Children sometimes run by, curiously peeking in, only to be gently invited by the elders to learn a few moves themselves. In the shade of the tree, time seems to slow down; each move on the chessboard carries life's wisdom and years of experience.
 
*宁静祥和的田园画卷。空气中飘散着刚切开的西瓜的清甜味道，孩子们在小河边嬉戏，他们的笑声宛如天籁，与自然的和谐旋律交相辉映。这一切都显得如此平凡却又让人感到满足和幸福。
村口那颗古老的槐树下，几位老人正在下着闲棋，不时传来他们的谈笑声和指点江山的豪迈。孩童们偶尔跑过，好奇地探头探脑，被一旁的长者温和地招呼着，让他们也来学几招。树荫下，时光仿佛慢了下来，每一颗棋子的落下都承载着人生的智慧和岁月的沉淀。*
