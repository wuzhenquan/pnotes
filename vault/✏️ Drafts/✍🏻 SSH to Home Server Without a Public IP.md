# SSH to Home Server Without a Public IP

Create Cloudflare Tunnel to my home server make me ssh to my home server without a Public IP. Just type `ssh <my_specify_ssh_domain_name>` (such as `ssh ssh.zhenquan.me`) . Then you ssh to the home server right now. It's free.
But free tools also bring some little trouble, it's now as fast and low Âª∂Êó∂ as directly ssh to public IP. If you have a static public IP, sure you just use the ssh with Pubic IP way. But if my home server don't have a static public IP, it is dynamic. So it's another way to ssh my home server conveniently if I don't mind the network fast.

This article will introduce how to ssh to my home server with cloudflare tunnel.
my home server system: Ubuntu 22.04

# Open my terminal to connect it
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install `cloudflared` on macOS
`brew install cloudflared`
2Ô∏è‚É£ Get the path of `cloudflared` ‚Üí `/opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared` ‚Üí run `which cloudflared`
3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure your SSH configuration file üëâüèª `~/.ssh/config`
`vim ~/.ssh/config`
```
Host ssh.example.com
ProxyCommand /opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
```



## Last word
via the dashboard is the simplest way. If you want to mange many tunnels and hostnames. Via the configuration file way is a better choice.
